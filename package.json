Rename your extracted folder to something simpler(example - 'cpps') 5. Open up the cpps folder 6. Download NodeJS (https://nodejs.org/en/) 7. Once the installation is finished, press **Windows Key + R** 8. Type in 'cmd' and hit enter 9. Direct yourself to the cpps folder using the 'cd' command(for me it would be '**cd C:\\cpps\\**') 10. Type in **npm init** and hit enter. 11. Keep pressing enter if it asks you any questions. 12. Type in **npm install express** and hit enter. Wait for the installation to happen. 13. Type in **npm install socket.io** and hit enter. Wait for the installation to happen. 14. Type in **cls** and hit enter. 15. Finally, type in **node game.js** and the command line window should prompt you with a 'Server started.' message. 16. Awesome! Open up a browser and go to **localhost:2000** (Remember you can only access this URL from your computer as you are hosting  the server so everything is safe!)",
